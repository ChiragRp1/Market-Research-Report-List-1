<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Antifreezes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ethylene Glycol Coolant</li><li>Propylene Glycol Coolant</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Car antifreezes are essential to protect engines from freezing and overheating. Ethylene glycol coolant is a popular antifreeze type due to its efficient heat transfer and low cost. It has excellent freeze protection but is toxic and requires careful handling. Propylene glycol coolant is a safer alternative as it is non-toxic and environmentally friendly, although it is less efficient in heat transfer and more expensive. Other antifreeze types include mixtures of ethylene and propylene glycol, as well as organic acid technology (OAT) coolants, each offering specific advantages and limitations to cater to different engine requirements.</p></p>
