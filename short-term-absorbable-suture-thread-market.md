<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Short Term Absorbable Suture Thread Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colorless</li><li>Violet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Short Term Absorbable Suture Thread is available in different types: Colorless and Violet. Colorless suture thread is transparent or white in color, making it nearly invisible after application, which is advantageous for cosmetically sensitive areas. On the other hand, Violet suture thread is purple in color, providing better visibility during surgical procedures, particularly in areas with complex tissue layers or when surgeons need a clear distinction. Both types offer temporary wound closure, eventually being absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for suture removal.</p></p>
