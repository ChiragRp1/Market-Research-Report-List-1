<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electrical Park Brake(EPB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Auto Hold</li><li>Without Auto Hold</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Electrical Park Brake (EPB) market can be categorized into two types: with Auto Hold and without Auto Hold. EPB systems with Auto Hold feature hold the vehicle stationary without the need for the driver to continuously press the brake pedal, allowing for greater ease during heavy traffic or on inclines. On the other hand, EPB systems without Auto Hold require the driver to keep pressing the brake pedal to keep the vehicle stationary. These two categories of EPB systems cater to different driver preferences and provide varying levels of convenience.</p></p>
