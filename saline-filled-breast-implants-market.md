<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Saline-filled Breast Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smooth Implant</li><li>Textured Implants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Saline-filled breast implants are available in two main types: smooth implants and textured implants. Smooth implants have a soft outer shell and provide a natural feel and movement. They are less likely to cause rippling or wrinkling but may have a higher risk of displacement. Textured implants, on the other hand, have a rough outer surface designed to adhere to the surrounding tissue, reducing the risk of displacement. However, they may have a higher risk of implant-related complications such as capsular contracture or implant-associated lymphoma.</p></p>
