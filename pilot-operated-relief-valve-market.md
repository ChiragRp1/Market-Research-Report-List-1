<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot-operated Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Non-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A pilot-operated relief valve is a type of safety valve used to control excess pressure in a system. The market for these valves can be classified into two types: closed type and non-closed type. In the closed type market, the valve is designed to close and seal itself when the pressure reaches a certain level. This prevents any leakage or release of the fluid. In contrast, the non-closed type market refers to valves that do not fully close when the pressure is relieved, allowing a controlled release of fluid.</p></p>
