<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trim Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trim Tabs</li><li>Interceptors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The trim systems market includes two main types: trim tabs and interceptors. Trim tabs are small, adjustable plates installed on the trailing edge of a boat's hull or stern drive, allowing for controlling the boat's pitch and roll. Interceptors, on the other hand, are adjustable profiles installed beneath the hull that dynamically lift or push down on the boat's tail to optimize performance and stability. Both systems help to improve maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and overall performance of boats in different water conditions.</p></p>
