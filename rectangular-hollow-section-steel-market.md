<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rectangular Hollow Section Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WeldedRHS</li><li>SeamlessRHS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Rectangular Hollow Section (RHS) steel market consists of two main types: Welded RHS and Seamless RHS. Welded RHS refers to steel sections that are created by welding together two longitudinal edges of a flat strip of steel, resulting in a rectangular shape. This process is cost-effective and commonly used in construction and infrastructure projects. On the other hand, Seamless RHS refers to steel sections that are manufactured without any welding, resulting in a structurally stronger product. This type is often preferred in applications where strength and durability are crucial.</p></p>
