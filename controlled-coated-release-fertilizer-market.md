<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled (Coated) Release Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-Coated Products</li><li>Non Polymer-Coated Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Controlled release fertilizers, also known as coated release fertilizers, are designed to slowly release nutrients into the soil over an extended period of time, providing a steady supply of nutrients to plants. There are two main types of controlled release fertilizers: polymer-coated products and non-polymer-coated products. Polymer-coated products have a thin layer of polymer coating that controls the release of nutrients, while non-polymer-coated products rely on a physical barrier to slow down the release. These types of fertilizers offer improved nutrient efficiency, reduced nutrient leaching, and reduced frequency of fertilizer application, resulting in cost savings and environmental benefits.</p></p>
