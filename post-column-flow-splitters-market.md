<p><ul><li>Double Fixed</li><li>Replaceable Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Post-column flow splitters are devices used in chromatography to split the flow of a sample after it has passed through a chromatographic column. There are three main types of post-column flow splitters: double fixed, replaceable fixed, and adjustable. </p><p>Double fixed flow splitters have two fixed flow rates that cannot be changed. Replaceable fixed flow splitters, on the other hand, allow the user to replace the fixed flow restrictor to adjust the flow rate. Finally, adjustable flow splitters provide the flexibility to manually adjust the flow rate using a knob or valve, allowing for precise control of sample splitting.</p></p>
