<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tension Rod Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Adjustable Type</li><li>Adjustable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive tension rod market consists of two main types: non-adjustable type and adjustable type. Non-adjustable tension rods are designed to provide a fixed level of tension in a vehicle's suspension system and cannot be altered once installed. On the other hand, adjustable tension rods can be modified to change the tension level, allowing for better customization and fine-tuning of the vehicle's suspension. Both types have their own advantages and are preferred by different types of users depending on their specific needs and preferences.</p></p>
