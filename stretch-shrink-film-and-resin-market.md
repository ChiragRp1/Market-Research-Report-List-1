<p><p>Stretch film and shrink film are types of packaging materials made from plastic resin. Stretch film is a stretchable plastic film that is commonly used to wrap and secure palletized goods during transportation and storage. It provides protection against dust, moisture, and tampering. Shrink film, on the other hand, is a type of plastic film that shrinks when heat is applied, wrapping tightly around the product to provide a secure and attractive packaging solution.</p><p>Resin is the raw material used in the production of stretch and shrink film. Polyethylene (PE) resin, particularly linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), is the most commonly used material due to its excellent stretch and shrink properties. Other resins such as polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are also used in certain applications.</p><p>The global stretch and shrink film and resin market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. The increasing demand for packaged goods, growth in e-commerce activities, and the need for efficient and sustainable packaging solutions are driving the market growth. Additionally, the growing industrialization and urbanization in emerging economies are further boosting the market.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the stretch and shrink film and resin market is the shift towards bio-based and biodegradable films. With increasing environmental concerns, manufacturers are developing films using bio-based resins derived from renewable sources such as corn and sugarcane. These eco-friendly films provide similar performance characteristics while reducing the carbon footprint.</p><p>Furthermore, advancements in film manufacturing technologies and the introduction of innovative packaging designs are also shaping the market. Companies are focusing on developing stretch and shrink films with enhanced properties such as puncture resistance, optical clarity, and improved sealability to cater to the diverse packaging requirements of various industries.</p><p>In conclusion, the stretch and shrink film and resin market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% during the forecast period. The market is driven by factors such as increasing demand for packaged goods and the need for efficient and sustainable packaging solutions.
