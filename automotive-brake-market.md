<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brakes</li><li>Drum Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake market encompasses two main types of braking systems: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use calipers mounted on the wheels to squeeze brake pads against a disc, creating friction that slows down or stops the vehicle. This system offers better performance, heat dissipation, and durability, making it popular in high-performance vehicles. On the other hand, drum brakes use friction shoes that press against a drum attached to the wheel hub. They are reliable and cost-effective, commonly used in smaller vehicles and rear wheels.</p></p>
