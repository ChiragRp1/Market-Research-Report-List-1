<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ion-Exchange Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heterogeneous Membrane</li><li>Homogeneous Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ion-exchange membrane market is categorized into two types: heterogeneous membrane and homogeneous membrane. Heterogeneous membranes consist of a matrix material with finely dispersed ion-exchange sites, enabling selective ion transport. Homogeneous membranes, on the other hand, have uniform ion-exchange sites throughout the membrane structure. Both types of membranes play a crucial role in various applications such as desalination, fuel cells, and water treatment. While the heterogeneous membrane offers higher selectivity, the homogeneous membrane provides better mechanical stability.</p></p>
