<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Diboride Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carbotherm al reduction method</li><li>Self-propagating Reaction（SHS）</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Titanium Diboride (TiB2) market consists of two methods of production: Carbotherm al reduction and Self-propagating Reaction (SHS). Carbotherm al reduction involves using carbon as a reducing agent to react with titanium oxide and boron oxide, resulting in the formation of TiB2. On the other hand, SHS is a combustion synthesis method where a mixture of titanium and boron reactants is ignited, producing an exothermic reaction that rapidly forms TiB2. Both methods are commonly employed in the production of TiB2 for various industrial applications.</p></p>
