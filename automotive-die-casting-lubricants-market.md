<p><strong>The Automotive Die Casting Lubricants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Chamber Machines</li><li>Cold chamber Machines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive die casting lubricants are used in both hot chamber and cold chamber machines for the production of automotive parts. Hot chamber machines, as the name suggests, have a built-in furnace that keeps the metal in a molten state, allowing for faster production cycles. Cold chamber machines, on the other hand, require the metal to be manually ladled into the machine. Both machines require die casting lubricants to ensure smooth flow of the molten metal and reduce wear on the mold cavity, resulting in improved product quality and longer die life.</p></p>
