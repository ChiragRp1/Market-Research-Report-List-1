<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grid-connected Photovoltaic Power Generation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Battery</li><li>Without Battery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Grid-connected photovoltaic power generation systems are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to generate clean and renewable energy. These systems can be categorized into two types: with battery and without battery. With battery systems store excess energy generated by the solar panels in batteries, allowing households or businesses to use this stored energy during times when the sun is not shining. Without battery systems do not store excess energy, rather it is directly fed into the grid for others to use, promoting a more efficient and sustainable energy distribution network.</p></p>
