<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beam Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam Couplings</li><li>Multi Beam Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Beam couplings are mechanical devices used to connect two shafts in order to transmit torque and rotational motion. They come in two main types: single beam couplings and multi beam couplings. </p><p>Single beam couplings have a single beam spanning between the two shafts, providing flexibility and torque transmission. They are compact and have low inertia, making them suitable for applications with limited space and high speeds.</p><p>Multi beam couplings, on the other hand, have multiple beams arranged in a parallel or helical pattern. This design allows for higher torque transmission and compensation of misalignment between the shafts. They are commonly used in precision positioning systems and applications requiring high torsional stiffness.</p></p>
