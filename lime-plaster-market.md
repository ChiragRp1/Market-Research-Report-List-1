<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lime Plaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrated Lime</li><li>Non-Hydraulic Lime</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lime plaster is a traditional building material that has two main types in the market: hydrated lime and non-hydraulic lime. Hydrated lime, also known as hydrated lime putty, is produced by adding water to quicklime, resulting in a versatile and easy-to-use plaster that sets by drying. On the other hand, non-hydraulic lime, also called air lime or non-hydraulic lime putty, hardens through carbonation when exposed to air. This type of lime plaster offers increased breathability and is suitable for use in historic preservation and eco-friendly construction projects. Both types have their unique characteristics and applications.</p></p>
