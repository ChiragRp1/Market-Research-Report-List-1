<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Spring for Railway Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Cooling</li><li>Cold Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the metal spring for railway vehicles market, there are two main types: hot cooling and cold cooling. Hot cooling refers to the process of producing springs by heating the metal to a high temperature and then cooling it rapidly. This method improves the spring's hardness and resistance to fatigue, making it suitable for heavy-duty railway applications. Cold cooling, on the other hand, involves the gradual cooling of the metal after being formed into a spring, resulting in a softer and more flexible product ideal for lighter railway vehicles.</p></p>
