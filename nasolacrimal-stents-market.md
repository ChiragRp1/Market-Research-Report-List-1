<p><strong>The Nasolacrimal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocanalicular Stents</li><li>Bicanalicular Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nasolacrimal stents are medical devices used to treat blockages in the tear drainage system. There are two main types of nasolacrimal stents: monocanalicular and bicanalicular. Monocanalicular stents are placed in a single tear duct, whereas bicanalicular stents are placed in both tear ducts. Monocanalicular stents are preferred for simpler cases with a single blockage, while bicanalicular stents are used for more complex cases involving multiple blockages or conditions. Both types help restore normal tear drainage, providing relief to patients suffering from tear duct obstruction.</p></p>
