<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Rated Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flammability</li><li>Normal Flammability</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire Rated Foam is a type of foam that has been specially manufactured to have fire-resistant properties. There are two main market types of Fire Rated Foam: Low Flammability and Normal Flammability. Low Flammability foam is designed to have a significantly reduced flammability compared to standard foam, making it less likely to ignite and spread fire. On the other hand, Normal Flammability foam still meets required fire safety standards but has a relatively higher level of flammability compared to Low Flammability foam. Both types aim to provide protection against fire hazards while allowing for specific application needs.</p></p>
