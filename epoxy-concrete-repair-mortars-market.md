<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Concrete Repair Mortars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deep-Filling Type</li><li>Fast-Cure Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Epoxy concrete repair mortars are categorized into two types: deep-filling type and fast-cure type. Deep-filling type mortars are specifically designed to repair deep cracks or holes in concrete structures. They have a higher viscosity and can be applied in thicker layers to ensure complete filling and bonding. On the other hand, fast-cure type mortars are formulated for quick repairs and have a shorter setting time. They are suitable for urgent repair works that require rapid curing to minimize downtime. Both types offer effective solutions for repairing and strengthening damaged concrete surfaces.</p></p>
