Single vision lenses are designed for correcting a single vision problem, such as nearsightedness or farsightedness. They provide a clear vision at a fixed distance. Progressive lenses, on the other hand, are multifocal lenses that offer a gradual transition from distance vision to intermediate and near vision, eliminating the need to switch between different eyeglasses for different distances. They are suitable for individuals with presbyopia, an age-related condition affecting near vision.</p></p>
