<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trauma Fixation Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stainless-steel</li><li>Titanium</li><li>Bioabsorbable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Trauma fixation screws are medical devices used to stabilize broken bones during the healing process. These screws come in different types, including stainless-steel, titanium, and bioabsorbable. Stainless-steel screws are durable and resistant to corrosion, making them a common choice. Titanium screws, on the other hand, are lightweight and biocompatible with the body. Bioabsorbable screws are made from materials that gradually dissolve over time, avoiding the need for a second surgery to remove them. Each type has its advantages and is used based on the patient's specific needs and the nature of the trauma.</p></p>
