<p><strong>The Photovoltaic PVDF Resin Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BlownFilm</li><li>CastFilm</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photovoltaic (PV) PVDF resin is a type of material that is used in the production of solar panels. It is applied in the form of blown film and cast film. Blown film refers to a manufacturing process where the resin is melted and blown into a bubble, which is then flattened and cooled to create a thin film. Cast film, on the other hand, involves the resin being poured onto a flat surface, usually a moving belt, and then cooled to form a solid film. Both blown film and cast film applications are critical in the production of photovoltaic PVDF resin, contributing to the efficiency and durability of solar panels.</p></p>
