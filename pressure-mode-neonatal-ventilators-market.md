<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pressure mode neonatal ventilators are medical devices that provide respiratory support to newborns who are unable to breathe on their own. There are two types of these ventilators - invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require the insertion of a breathing tube into the baby's airway, while non-invasive ventilators deliver respiratory support through masks or nasal prongs. These devices help ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and can be adjusted to deliver different levels of pressure based on the baby's specific respiratory needs.</p></p>
