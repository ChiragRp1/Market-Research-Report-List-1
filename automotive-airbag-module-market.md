<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airbag Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas Generator</li><li>Air Bag</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive airbag module market consists of two main types: gas generator and air bag. Gas generator modules use a stored chemical energy source to create a gas that rapidly inflates the airbag during a collision. These modules are highly reliable and widely used in modern vehicles. On the other hand, the air bag module is the inflatable component that deploys upon impact, providing a cushioned barrier between occupants and the vehicle's interior structure, reducing the risk of injuries. Both gas generator and air bag modules are essential safety features in automotive vehicles.</p></p>
